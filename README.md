# Social Network API

## Description

In this repository I built an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. 

I used a MongoDB database, [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express), and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages.

## Installation

Be sure to have MongoDB installed and running on your machine before you get started.

  1. Fork the repository so that you have a local copy saved on your computer.
  2. Navigate to the forked repository on your computer using your command line application.
  3. Navigate to the main "social-network-api" repository folder, then enter 'node index.js' in the command line application to turn on the server.

Use the application to CRUD users and thoughts, as well as create and delete reactions (to thoughts) and friends (on users' friend lists).
